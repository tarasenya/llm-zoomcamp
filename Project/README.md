# LLM final Project

## Brief description of the project

Everyday one confronts with vague statements of his/her boss. Often a boss tries to formulate tasks, give pieces of advice indirect, which causes lots of misunderstanding. Experiencing this from time to time I considered it to be a good idea to build a RAG, which helps an IT employee to understand what a boss really wants. Hence an aim of this project is:
- to build a RAG system that gets a vague question/statement from a boss and 'translates' it into the form one can unambiguously understand.
- build a UI for this RAG system
- Containerize it and deploy to a GCP
